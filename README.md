## What is SOSialism?

> "It does not matter what you try to do in the health care field, someone on cable news will call it socialism. Might as well do it yourself too."

The SOSialism app helps you compare different operations at different hospitals based on price and quality. Super handy if you need a brain surgery and are on a tight budget!

The app was built during AngelHack AppHack SF. Powered CMS.gov and Yelp.
