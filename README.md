## What is SOSialism?

> "Whatever you do with health care, someone on cable news is going to call it socialism."

The SOSialism app helps you compare different operations at different hospitals based on price and quality. Super handy if you need a brain surgery and are on a tight budget!

The app was built during AngelHack AppHack SF. Powered CMS.gov and Yelp.
